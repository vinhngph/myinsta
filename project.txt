What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?
In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it’s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?

Step 1 of 3:
Create a short video (that’s no more than 3 minutes in length) in which you present your project to the world. Your video must begin with an opening section that displays:
    - your project’s title: Clone Instagram
    - your name;
    - your GitHub and edX usernames;
    - your city and country;
    - and, the date you have recorded this video.
You’re welcome to use an actual camera. Upload your video to YouTube (or, if blocked in your country, a similar site) and take note of its URL; it’s fine to flag it as “unlisted,” but don’t flag it as “private.”
